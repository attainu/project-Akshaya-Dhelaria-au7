<h1>Coding Hunt</h1>

The main aim of building this was to get all the best tutorials at one place so that each learner can visit here, get some good resources of the programming language and learn. Coding Hunt lets learners identify the most suitable course of their choice.

<h1>Creating An App</h1>

You’ll need to have Node 8.16.0 or Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine (but it’s not required on the server). You can use nvm (macOS/Linux) or nvm-windows to switch Node versions between different projects.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

 <em> npx create-react-app my-app</em> (npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see instructions for older npm versions)

  <em>npm init react-app my-app</em>

<h1>Installation</h1>

Please run <em>npm install</em> to get required packages

You can also update the packages by <em>npm update</em>

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
Express,
JsonWebTokens,
Bcrypt,
Express-Validator,
Nodemailer,
MongoDB,
React,
Axios

<h1>Future scope</h1>
 Planning to add the feature where the learner can identify the most suitable course of their choice by allowing them to filter courses by fee, course type (video/ebook etc.)
